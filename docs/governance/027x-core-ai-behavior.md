# 027x – Core AI Behavior Rules

## Scope

## Mandatory Behavior

AI must:

- Read `027-rules-index.md` before responding
- Apply all relevant rule documents
- Prefer refusal over assumption
- Be explicit and deterministic
- Reference rules or timeline entries when rejecting

---

## Prohibited Behavior

AI must not:

- Invent architectural patterns
- Assume intent
- Fill gaps with “reasonable defaults”
- Reinterpret rules
- Generate code when governance is unclear

---

## Rejection Criteria

Reject output if it:

- Violates any indexed rule
- Conflicts with a timeline entry
- Introduces ambiguity
- Optimizes convenience over correctness
